🧠 I'm a final-year Information Systems student at the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), Brazil.  
Currently working on my thesis: **"The Hidden Game: AI-Powered Detection of Match-Fixing in Football"** — where machine learning meets the pitch.

🚀 I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it's turning data into insights or building clean and creative interfaces, I’m all in.

🛠️ Tools & Tech I’ve been playing with lately:

📚 Always learning, always building — sometimes breaking things (on purpose).  
Currently diving deeper into:
- 🧠 AI & Machine Learning  
- 📈 Data Analytics & Visualization  
- 🎨 Front-end development
